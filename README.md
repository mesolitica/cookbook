## Concurrency

All API support concurrency requests, it means,

1. If you have a batch of texts, you can fire multiple requests at the same without impacting the latency, same goes to Speech API.
2. For Websocket Speech API, you can connect multiple users from your side to do real-time audio streaming to the Websocket server.
